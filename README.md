# Simple-Graph
This repository contains a simple implementation of a graph class in C++, using an adjacency list to represent the edges between vertices.

## Features
- [x] Support for adding vertices
- [x] Support for adding edges between vertices
- [x] Efficient storage of edges using an adjacency list
- [ ] Breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithms implemented for traversing the graph
